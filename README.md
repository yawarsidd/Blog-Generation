# Blog-Generation
Create main.py (Colab/Kaggle) i.e for FASTAPI endpoints which consist of uploading the model, scrapping the text, create endpoint for blog generation which consist of prompt template.
Then used ngork (colab/Kaggle) to expose the backend part of the fastapi endpoints and generating URL.
Then used streamlit locally on machine to create app.py (http://192.168.204.13:8501) based on the Ngork URL using Requests.
